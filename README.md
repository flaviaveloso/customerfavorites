# CUSTOMER FAVORITES

## Description

The purpose of this project is to allow customers to set theirs favorites products.

To use this API you need to create a USER using the path: v1/user  
(There are two types of roles: admin and user)

Example:

```base
curl --location --request POST 'localhost:3000/v1/user' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "username":"username",
    "password":"password",
    "roles": ["user"]
}'
```

To use the other endpoints you need to recover the jwt token using the path: /auth/login  
The request's body receives an USER created on the previous endpoint

Example:

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'localhost:3000/auth/login' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "username": "username",
    "password": "password"
}'
```
